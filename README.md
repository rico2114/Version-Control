# Version-Control
This is a huge project worked in my leisure time made in Java. This project handles a new version control system.

The version control system is a very modular system which consists in 3 pieces (The client, The servlet, The String interpreter).
The client handles all the per user work, advance forward, advance backward, push and pull.
The servlet takes care of all the client transmision to the website.
The string interpreter takes care of the string operations to be injected into the client (works as a library.)
